I'm Thomas Chiocchetti. I'm 15 and I am attending the School of Informatic and Telecommunication in Bolzano (https://iisgalilei.eu). I've been playing piano for seven years. I like playing classical music but not only, which means I play different types of music. In my free time code websites and I learn german.
